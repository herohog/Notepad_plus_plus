RFC: Add ability to drag and drop selected txt to an area above or below the currently viewed screen by simply moving the mouse to/past the screen border to cause the screen to scroll to the desired new area.
Current work arounds require either keyboard input or “extra” mouse clicks instead of a simple drag and drop. This is something I do often so it popped up on my radar when I switched to Notepad++.
