Retired Sr Programmer/Analyst who started out as a Master Mechanic/Racer/Car & Bike Builder but was disabled in the US Navy and eventually couldn't work as a mechanic so went to college through the VA and became a computer geek just as home computers were becoming a "thing." I was also a gigging Blues/Funk/Classic rock drummer in my spare time for many years and worked as a Classic Rock FM Radio DJ for a year or so in my off hours. I finally got so bad physically that I was forced into retirement and now I live in my recliner surfing the web.
